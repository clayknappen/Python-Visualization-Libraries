# Python-Visualization-Libraries
My exploration into two visualization libraries for Python (Matplotlib and Altair). 

So far it involves three Jupyter Notebooks. 

1. Area Plots - GDP Components: this notebook explores making area plots with Matplotlib and Altair for the components that comprise GDP. 
2. Waffle Plot - a function for making waffle plots with Matplotlib
3. 2016 Election - playing with exploring county level voting results from the 2016 presidential election with Basemap and Matplotlib
